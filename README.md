# admin-dashboard

[LIVE](https://bugthug.github.io/admin-dashboard)

Admin dashboard is my 5th project from starting [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/). It was definitely one of the harder ones, and it took me the most days so far to complete.

This project was used mostly to teach me how to use CSS grid layout, and I think it succeeded in that.
For future projects, I'll probably use learn Tailwind as that seems like it could save a lot of CSS-related brain hemorrhage.

Also, I feel as if I did not use git in an orderly manner, but a bit sporadically. This will be someone to pay attention to for future projects.
